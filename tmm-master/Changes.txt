version 0.1.3, 2014-06-11 -- 2 minor improvements in color module: There was an inaccurate statement in the documentation (rgb is NOT gamma-corrected), and added irgb (which IS gamma-corrected) to the dictionary returned by calc_color()
version 0.1.4, 2014-09-10 -- print warning when highly-opaque layers are artificially modified; more checks for invalid inputs; clarify documentation a bit.
