# PVwindow: Photovoltaic Window Simulation Software

## 
PVwindow integrates existing open source simulation codes to create a novel tool for modeling photovoltaic windows. Windows are modeled as a stack with solar irradiation impinging the outer surface with an arbitrary angle of incidence. The amount of absorption is determined in each layer. Photovoltaic layers convert some of the absorbed solar power into electrical power according to an adapted Shockleyâ€“Queisser model with a set internal quantum efficiency.[^1] The code outputs:
 - the power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic window
 - the solar heat gain coefficient
 - The visible light transmission
 - the color of transmitted light and apparent window color window
