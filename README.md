# PVwindow
## Photovoltaic window simulation software

PVwindow integrates existing open source simulation codes to create a novel tool for modeling photovoltaic windows. Windows are modeled as a stack with solar irradiation impinging the outer surface with an arbitrary angle of incidence. The amount of absorption is determined in each layer. Photovoltaic layers convert a some of the absorbed solar power into electrical power according to an adapted Shockleyâ€“Queisser model with a set internal quantum efficiency.[^1] The color of light and window are determined from the spectrum of transmitted light.
