v0.2.2 (November 13, 2015)
--------------------------

This is a minor release from 0.2.1.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Adds Python 3.5 compatibility (:issue:`87`)
* Moves the Linke turbidity lookup into ``clearsky.lookup_linke_turbidity``.
  The API for ``clearsky.ineichen`` remains the same. (:issue:`95`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* ``irradiance.total_irrad`` had a typo that required the
  Klucher model to be accessed with ``'klutcher'``. Both spellings will work
  for the remaining 0.2.* versions of pvlib,
  but the misspelled method will be removed in 0.3.
  (:issue:`97`)
* Fixes an import and KeyError in the IPython notebook tutorials
  (:issue:`94`).
* Uses the ``logging`` module properly by replacing ``format``
  calls with ``args``. This results in a 5x speed increase for
  ``tracking.singleaxis`` (:issue:`89`).
* Adds a link to the 2015 PVSC paper (:issue:`81`)
