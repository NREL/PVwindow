v0.2.0 (July 6, 2015)
-----------------------

This is a major release from 0.1 and includes a large number of API changes,
several new features and enhancements along with a number of bug fixes.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.

Due to the large number of API changes, you will probably need to update your
code.


API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~

* Change variable names to conform with new
  `Variables and style rules wiki <https://github.com/pvlib/pvlib-python/wiki/Variables-and-style-rules>`_.
  This impacts many function declarations and return values.
  Your existing code probably will not work! (:issue:`37`, :issue:`54`).
* Move ``dirint`` and ``disc`` algorithms from ``clearsky.py``
  to ``irradiance.py`` (:issue:`42`)
* Mark some ``pvsystem.py`` methods as private (:issue:`20`)
* Make output of ``pvsystem.sapm_celltemp`` a DataFrame (:issue:`54`)

Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add conda installer
* PEP8 fixups to solarposition.py and spa.py (:issue:`50`)
* Add optional ``projection_ratio`` keyword argument to the ``haydavies``
  calculator. Speeds calculations when irradiance changes but
  solar position remains the same (:issue:`58`)
* Improved installation instructions in README.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* fix local build of the documentation (:issue:`49`, :issue:`56`)
* The release date of 0.1 was fixed in the documentation
  (see :ref:`whatsnew_0100`)
* fix casting of DateTimeIndex to int64 epoch timestamp on machines with 32 bit python int (:issue:`63`)
* fixed some docstrings with failing doctests (:issue:`62`)
