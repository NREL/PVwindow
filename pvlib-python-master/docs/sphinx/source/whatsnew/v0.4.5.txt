v0.4.5 (June 5, 2017)
---------------------


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fix pandas 0.20 incompatibilities in Location.get_clearsky,
  solarposition.ephemeris (:issue:`325`)
* Fixes timezone issue in solarposition spa_c function (:issue:`237`)
* Added NREL Bird clear sky model. (:issue:`276`)
* Added lower accuracy formulas for equation of time, declination, hour angle
  and solar zenith.
* Remove all instances of .ix (:issue:`322`)
* Update docstring in `pvlib.spa.solar_position` - change units of pressure to
  millibars. *NOTE*: units of pressure in `pvlib.solar_position.spa_python` and
  `pvlib.solar_position.spa_c` are still Pascals. This update should have no
  effect on most users, since it only applies to the low-level `spa.py` module.
  (:issue:`327`)


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added irradiance.dni method that determines DNI from GHI and DHI and corrects
  unreasonable DNI values during sunrise/sunset transitions
* ForecastModel will now only connect to the Unidata server when necessary,
  rather than when the object is created. This supports offline work
  and speeds up analysis of previously downloaded data.
