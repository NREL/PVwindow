v0.3.1 (April 19, 2016)
-----------------------

This is a minor release from 0.3.0.
We recommend that all users upgrade to this version.


Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added versioneer to keep track of version changes instead
  of manually updating pvlib/version.py. This will aid
  developers because the version string includes the specific
  git commit of the library code currently imported. (issue:`150`)


Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

* Fixes night tare issue in snlinverter. When the DC input power (p_dc)
  to an inverter is below the inversion startup power (Ps0), the model
  should set the AC output (ac_power) to the night tare value (Pnt).
  The night tare power indicates the power consumed by the inverter to
  sense PV array voltage. The model was erroneously comparing Ps0 with
  the AC output power (ac_power), rather than the DC input power (p_dc).
  (:issue:`140`)

* Fixed the azimuth calculation of rotated PV panel in function
  pvlib.tracking.singleaxis(...) so that the results are consistent
  with PVsyst. (:issue:`144`)
