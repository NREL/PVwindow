class SingleAxisTracker(PVSystem):
    """
    A class for single-axis trackers that inherits the PV modeling methods from
    :py:class:`~pvlib.pvsystem.PVSystem`. For details on calculating tracker
    rotation see :py:func:`pvlib.tracking.singleaxis`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    axis_tilt : float, default 0
        The tilt of the axis of rotation (i.e, the y-axis defined by
        axis_azimuth) with respect to horizontal, in decimal degrees.

    axis_azimuth : float, default 0
        A value denoting the compass direction along which the axis of
        rotation lies. Measured in decimal degrees east of north.

    max_angle : float, default 90
        A value denoting the maximum rotation angle, in decimal degrees,
        of the one-axis tracker from its horizontal position (horizontal
        if axis_tilt = 0). A max_angle of 90 degrees allows the tracker
        to rotate to a vertical position to point the panel towards a
        horizon. max_angle of 180 degrees allows for full rotation.

    backtrack : bool, default True
        Controls whether the tracker has the capability to "backtrack"
        to avoid row-to-row shading. False denotes no backtrack
        capability. True denotes backtrack capability.

    gcr : float, default 2.0/7.0
        A value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker system
        which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV array
        surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules
        2 meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters
        between the tracking axes has a gcr of 2/6=0.333. If gcr is not
        provided, a gcr of 2/7 is default. gcr must be <=1.

    cross_axis_tilt : float, default 0.0
        The angle, relative to horizontal, of the line formed by the
        intersection between the slope containing the tracker axes and a plane
        perpendicular to the tracker axes. Cross-axis tilt should be specified
        using a right-handed convention. For example, trackers with axis
        azimuth of 180 degrees (heading south) will have a negative cross-axis
        tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes down to the east and positive
        cross-axis tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes up to the east. Use
        :func:`~pvlib.tracking.calc_cross_axis_tilt` to calculate
        `cross_axis_tilt`. [degrees]

    **kwargs
        Passed to :py:class:`~pvlib.pvsystem.PVSystem`. If the `arrays`
        parameter is specified it must have only a single Array. Furthermore
        if a :py:class:`~pvlib.pvsystem.Array` is provided it must have
        ``surface_tilt`` and ``surface_azimuth`` equal to None.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If more than one Array is specified.
    ValueError
        If an Array is provided with a surface tilt or azimuth not None.

    """
    Determine the rotation angle of a single-axis tracker when given particular
    solar zenith and azimuth angles.

    See [1]_ for details about the equations. Backtracking may be specified,
    and if so, a ground coverage ratio is required.

    Rotation angle is determined in a right-handed coordinate system. The
    tracker `axis_azimuth` defines the positive y-axis, the positive x-axis is
    90 degrees clockwise from the y-axis and parallel to the Earth's surface,
    and the positive z-axis is normal to both x & y-axes and oriented skyward.
    Rotation angle `tracker_theta` is a right-handed rotation around the y-axis
    in the x, y, z coordinate system and indicates tracker position relative to
    horizontal. For example, if tracker `axis_azimuth` is 180 (oriented south)
    and `axis_tilt` is zero, then a `tracker_theta` of zero is horizontal, a
    `tracker_theta` of 30 degrees is a rotation of 30 degrees towards the west,
    and a `tracker_theta` of -90 degrees is a rotation to the vertical plane
    facing east.

    Parameters
    ----------
    apparent_zenith : float, 1d array, or Series
        Solar apparent zenith angles in decimal degrees.

    apparent_azimuth : float, 1d array, or Series
        Solar apparent azimuth angles in decimal degrees.

    axis_tilt : float, default 0
        The tilt of the axis of rotation (i.e, the y-axis defined by
        axis_azimuth) with respect to horizontal, in decimal degrees.

    axis_azimuth : float, default 0
        A value denoting the compass direction along which the axis of
        rotation lies. Measured in decimal degrees east of north.

    max_angle : float, default 90
        A value denoting the maximum rotation angle, in decimal degrees,
        of the one-axis tracker from its horizontal position (horizontal
        if axis_tilt = 0). A max_angle of 90 degrees allows the tracker
        to rotate to a vertical position to point the panel towards a
        horizon. max_angle of 180 degrees allows for full rotation.

    backtrack : bool, default True
        Controls whether the tracker has the capability to "backtrack"
        to avoid row-to-row shading. False denotes no backtrack
        capability. True denotes backtrack capability.

    gcr : float, default 2.0/7.0
        A value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker system
        which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV array
        surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules
        2 meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters
        between the tracking axes has a gcr of 2/6=0.333. If gcr is not
        provided, a gcr of 2/7 is default. gcr must be <=1.

    cross_axis_tilt : float, default 0.0
        The angle, relative to horizontal, of the line formed by the
        intersection between the slope containing the tracker axes and a plane
        perpendicular to the tracker axes. Cross-axis tilt should be specified
        using a right-handed convention. For example, trackers with axis
        azimuth of 180 degrees (heading south) will have a negative cross-axis
        tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes down to the east and positive
        cross-axis tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes up to the east. Use
        :func:`~pvlib.tracking.calc_cross_axis_tilt` to calculate
        `cross_axis_tilt`. [degrees]

    Returns
    -------
    dict or DataFrame with the following columns:
        * `tracker_theta`: The rotation angle of the tracker.
          tracker_theta = 0 is horizontal, and positive rotation angles are
          clockwise. [degrees]
        * `aoi`: The angle-of-incidence of direct irradiance onto the
          rotated panel surface. [degrees]
        * `surface_tilt`: The angle between the panel surface and the earth
          surface, accounting for panel rotation. [degrees]
        * `surface_azimuth`: The azimuth of the rotated panel, determined by
          projecting the vector normal to the panel's surface to the earth's
          surface. [degrees]

def calc_cross_axis_tilt(

    """
    Calculate the angle, relative to horizontal, of the line formed by the
    intersection between the slope containing the tracker axes and a plane
    perpendicular to the tracker axes.

    Use the cross-axis tilt to avoid row-to-row shade when backtracking on a
    slope not parallel with the axis azimuth. Cross-axis tilt should be
    specified using a right-handed convention. For example, trackers with axis
    azimuth of 180 degrees (heading south) will have a negative cross-axis tilt
    if the tracker axes plane slopes down to the east and positive cross-axis
    tilt if the tracker axes plane slopes up to the east.

    Parameters
    ----------
    slope_azimuth : float
        direction of the normal to the slope containing the tracker axes, when
        projected on the horizontal [degrees]
    slope_tilt : float
        angle of the slope containing the tracker axes, relative to horizontal

    axis_azimuth : float
        direction of tracker axes projected on the horizontal [degrees]
    axis_tilt : float

    Returns
    -------
    cross_axis_tilt : float
        angle, relative to horizontal, of the line formed by the intersection
